# Monkey patching

To start, I will store the original value of `globalThis.console.log` in a standalone variable before anything else happens:

<CodeFile file="print-server-url.test.ts" range="3" />

Next, I create a mock function called `consoleLogSpy`.

<CodeFile file="print-server-url.test.ts" range="4" />

> :owl: Note that you can annotate the `vi.fn()` function by providing it the function's parameters and return type as type arguments.

This spy will give me the superpowers to observe the `console.log` calls but not until I assign it as the value of `globalThis.console.log`:

<CodeFile file="print-server-url.test.ts" range="6-8,14-16" />

> Do not forget the `afterAll` cleaning step!

Since there are two test scenarios for the `printServerUrl()` function (the server with and without the port number), I need to make sure that all the spying metadata in `consoleLogSpy` gets reset between the tests.

<CodeFile file="print-server-url.test.ts" range="10-12" />

Now, the only thing left is to add the assertions on the `consoleLogSpy` calls:

<CodeFile file="print-server-url.test.ts" range="18-25" highlight="21-24" />

<CodeFile file="print-server-url.test.ts" range="27-34" highlight="30-33" />

If I run `npm test`, I can see both test cases passing, which verifies the testing setup (monkey patching) as well as test isolation (the `afterEach` hook) :tada:.

```
 ✓ print-server-url.test.ts (2)
   ✓ prints the server message for url with host and no port
   ✓ prints the server message for url with host and port
```

## Dangers of monkey patching

Monkey patching may seem like the easiest technique to control global dependencies, however, I would actively _advise against it_. You must certainly not use monkey patching in the application code, but even in tests, prefer not to rely on it directly.

Any engineering decision comes with a cost, and monkey patching not only has that but also a few dangers that are not always immediately apparent. Perhaps, it's a tool far too powerful to wield.

It's written for open-source library maintainers but it contains a lot of useful examples and points as to what dangers surface once you modify the things you do not own.

Luckily, we will talk about the alternatives to monkey patching in the following exercises.
