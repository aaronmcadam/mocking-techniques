# Proxy

Let's start this exercise by removing the previous monkey patching of `globalThis.console.log`:

```ts filename=print-server-url.test.ts remove=1 nocopy
globalThis.console.log = consoleLogSpy
```

Next, I will create a new `Proxy` over the `globalThis.console.log` method and provide it with a trap called `apply`.

```ts filename=print-server-url.test.ts
new Proxy(globalThis.console.log, {
  apply(target, thisArg, argArray) {
    consoleLogSpy.apply(this, arguments)
    // return Reflect.apply(target, thisArg, argArray)
  },
})
```

> :owl: A _trap_ is a function that defines the behavior for the corresponding object internal method. So the `apply` trap controls the function calls, the `get` trap describes the getters, etc. [Learn more about `Proxy` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy).

In the `apply` trap, I am forwarding all the `arguments` passed to that trap onto the `consoleLogSpy()` mock function. This means that whenever `globalThis.console.log` is called during the test, it invokes the `apply` trap, and then calls the `consoleLogSpy()` with the same arguments passed to the original `console.log()` call.

> :owl: One of the powers of Proxy is that you can tap into the original, unproxied functionality of any trap easily via the [`Reflect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect) object. Like in this case, you can call `Reflect.apply(target, thisArg, argArray)` to invoke the original `console.log()` call before or after the mock has been called.

In order for the tested code to reach the proxy whenever `console.log()` is called, I will reassign the value of `globalThis.console.log` to the proxy object:

<CodeFile file="print-server-url.test.ts" range="6-13" highlight="7" />

To be absolutely clearâ€”_this is still monkey patching_. However, instead of replacing the global with a blackbox, we are using a proxy wrapper, which is both less intrusive and more flexible.

The rest of the test suite stays the same.

## Using Proxy

The `Proxy` API is immensely powerful. You are unlikely to use it in product development but it can come in handy when debugging your code or creating libraries. In fact, libraries like Immer use `Proxy` to implement the concept of "draft" objects, allowing you to mutate things in an immutable way.

> :scroll: I have also written on how I use proxies when debugging in [Debugging Like A Pro-xy](https://kettanaito.com/blog/debugging-like-a-pro-xy). It's a really neat technique when you know what the problematic surface is but you don't know (or don't have access) to where it's defined.

Although our test setup has got better, it still relies on monkey patching. I think it's time to finally change that!
