# Proxy

Proxying is an alternative to monkey patching with one crucial difference. If monkey patching is replacing the thing entirely, eventually calling the original logic, then proxying is _wrapping_ the thing, keeping the original logic, and eventually calling your custom one.

In the context of this exercise, I will be referring to the [Proxy API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) in JavaScript whenever I say "proxying". `Proxy` is a standard API that allows you to, well, proxy any object to observe and modify its behavior.

Here's a basic example of using Proxy:

```ts highlight=6-15,19
// This is the original object "user".
const user = { name: 'John', age: 32 }

// Creaet a proxy over the "user" object.
const proxyUser = new Proxy(user, {
  get(target, propertyName) {
    // If getting a property which name is "name"...
    if (propertyName === 'name') {
      // ...return a different (e.g. mock) value.
      return 'Sarah'
    }

    // Otherwise, return the original value.
    return Reflect.get(...arguments)
  },
})

// The proxied property returns a custom value.
proxyUser.name // "Sarah"

// Other properties are intact.
proxyUser.age // 32
```

Even from this example you may notice that `Proxy` doesn't replace the `user`, it creates a _new_, proxied object that wraps around the original one. It doesn't do the "replace" part, only the "control" part. That's really handy when debugging, for example, as you can pass the `proxyUser` strategically to some consumers and see what properties they access or methods they call.

When mocking globals, that "replace" part is quite important. Although we can creaet a `consoleProxy` object, we wouldn't be able to instruct our tested code to use the proxy instead of the global `console`.

That being said, proxying objects still has tremendous benefits compared to monkey patching.
