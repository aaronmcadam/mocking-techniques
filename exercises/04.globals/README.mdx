# Globals

At its core, mocking is a _dependency-management technique_. Whether you depend on things like date and time, particular built-in APIs or globals, other modules or calls to third-party servicesâ€”knowing which dependencies to allow in a test affects the type and extent of that test.

All dependencies you encounter can be put into two groups:

- Explicit dependencies (things you `import()` yourself);
- Implicit dependencies (i.e. globals).

In this exercise, you will focus on mocking _global_ dependencies. Those are implicit since you don't import them manually and instead get them from the `globalThis` object of your environment, most commonly just referencing them by their name.

```ts nocopy nonumber
console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV)
^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^
```

> Above is a quick example of the global `console` object printing a message that contains an environment variable taken from another global `process` object and its `env` property.

Globals are also not limited to built-in native APIs, as you can create your own variables and expose them globally in your application.

## Dangers of mocking globals

Mocking globals, however, can be quite dangerous. That is mostly due to the fact that globals are often the things _you do not own_. You don't own the `console` or the `process` object. You haven't defined them, have no access to their implementation, and aren't aware of countless intricacies they may have with other globals.

You should only worry about a subset of dangers since you will be mocking globals only within your test suite. That does not mean you are entirely safe, and that is why knowing different mocking techniques (and their downsides!) is crucial.
