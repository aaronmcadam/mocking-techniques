At its core, mocking is a _dependency-management technique_. Whether you depend on your own module's methods, or a third-party module, or calls to an external serviceâ€”knowing which dependencies to allow in a test affects what that test is doing.

There are two main groups of dependencies:

- Explicit dependencies (things you `import()` yourself);
- Implicit dependencies (i.e. globals).

In this exercise block, we will focus on mocking _global_ dependencies.

## Global dependencies

- Standard APIs.
- Your own things you expose globally.
