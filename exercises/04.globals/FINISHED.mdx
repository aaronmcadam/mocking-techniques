# Globals

Woah, another exercise done! :tada:

I hope this one gave you enough context on different techniques when it comes to mocking globals. You can certainly employ whichever one you find most suitable for a particular situation, but when it comes to tests, I highly recommend relying on the `vi.spyOn()` and `vi.stubGlobal()` APIs from Vitest.
