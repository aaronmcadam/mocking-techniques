# Monkey patching

In our <InlineFile file="print-server-url.ts" /> module, we have a `printServerUrl()` function that takes a `Server` object and prints its URL to the console.

<CodeFile file="print-server-url.ts" range="6-12" nocopy />

What interests us in this function is that it has the `console` object as a _global dependency_. It exists on the global scope but we still need to gain control over it in test so we can spy on its calls and control its behavior.

One of the ways to do that is to use _monkey patching_.

## Monkey patching

_Monkey patching_ is a technique to change the behavior of a piece of code at runtime.

> :owl: The term "monkey patching" originates from the original name for this technique‚Äîguerrilla (as in "partisan") patching. Historically, it referred to doing sneaky changes (patches) to the code, deserving its name. As time went by, "guerrilla" became "gorilla" due to how similar the two sound, eventually becoming "monkey".

Notice that monkey patching is not exclusive to patching globals, and you can also monkey patch your own code just the same. Neither is it a testing technique per se, although in this exercise you will learn to wield it as such!

Despite you not interacting with monkey patching directly yet, almost every Vitest API you've been using up to this point utilizes patching under the hood to work:

- `vi.spyOn()` patches any given object to record calls to its methods;
- `vi.useFakeTimers()` patches the `globalThis.Date` constructor to control time.

In practice, "patching" something simply means _reassigning its value_:

```ts nocopy
const instance = new MyClass()

const originalMethod = instance.method

instance.method = function (args) {
  console.log('method() is called!')
  return originalMethod.apply(this, args)
}
```

In the example above, we are patching the `.method` on the `instance` to print something to console before actually invoking that method. We are _modifying_ its behavior not as a part of the `MyClass` declaration but during runtime.

## Back to tests!

üë®‚Äçüíº Use monkey patching to replace the value of `globalThis.console.log` with a _mock function_ (`vi.fn()`) and complete the test suite at <InlineFile file="print-server-url.test.ts" />.
