# Mocking behaviors

## TODO

- Showcase a dependency on an SDK (imagine third party). It's too complex to mock its side effects directly, and that alone may leak more implementation detail than the module name.
- Use Vitest to _control_ the SDK's behavior (i.e. make its method return predictable results).
