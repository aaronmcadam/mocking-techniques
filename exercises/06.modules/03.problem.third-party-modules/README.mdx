# Third-party modules

- 3rd party module are more common to mock but still, make sure you cannot achieve what you want by mocking values or behaviors first.

```ts
import { db } from 'db'

export async function foo() {
  // You'd likely want to mock the `db` here.
  const client = await db.connect()

  client.foo()
}
```

- TODO That _is_ implementation detail testing. Ideally, you shouldn't know about the dependency on `db` here.
