# Auto-mocking

I will call the `vi.mock()` function and provide it only with the path to the module I wish to mock.

<CodeFile file="handle-request.test.ts" range="3" />

> Note that although the source module is `logger.ts` (the `.ts` extension) because the test has to _compile_ first before it's run. Once it compiles. `*.ts` becomes `*.js` and the import path becomes valid.

I don't have to explicitly describe the module's exports in the `factory` argument, and can instead rely on Vitest auto-mocking everything the `./logger.js` module exports for me.

Now, whenever Vitest encounters an import to `./logger.js`, it will replace that module with the mock implementation returned from the factory. This allows me to test the logic in the `handleRequest` function excluding the logging.

```
npm test
```

```
 ✓ handle-request.test.ts (2)
   ✓ returns the successful response for an authorized request
   ✓ throws an error for an unauthorized request
```
