# Auto-mocking

The reasons to mock a modules are rare but never zero.

Like our `handleRequest` function that depends on the local `./logger.js` module to log things while handling a request:

<CodeFile file="handle-request.ts" highlight="1,4,7,14" />

While logging is a part of this function, it's not integral to the main intention behdin it‚Äîto handle a given request. We may as well exclude the logging from it altogether during the test, bringing our focus closer to the intention at hand.

We can do that by mocking the entire dependency on the `./logger.js` module.

In Vitest, there are multiple ways to mock a module. In this exercise, we will be using the [`vi.mock()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-mock) function, which looks like this:

```ts
vi.mock('./path/to/module.js', factory)
```

It consists of two parts:

1. A path to the module to mock (local or third party);
1. A factory function of the mock implementation. This function is called every time this module is imported in the test, and whatever it returns is used as the exports of that module.

The call to the `vi.mock()` function is _hoisted_, which means it's always moved to the top of the test file, no matter where it's called. This is crucial because module mocking is generally sensitive to import order.

üë®‚Äçüíº Complete the test suite at <InlineFile file="handle-request.test.ts" /> by mocking the `./logger.js` module. And, as always, the tests shall pass!
