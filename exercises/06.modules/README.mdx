# Modules

- Mocking modules should be a last resort. This sets the boundary quite far (?). In most situations, you are far betteer off with mocking inputs or side effects, not modules.
- The problem with mocking modules is that most of the times you lose nothing by letting the dependency execute. You are really interested in mocking/controlling the values/behaviors, not the entire module.
