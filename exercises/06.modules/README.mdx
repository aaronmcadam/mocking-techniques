# Modules

Mocking modules should be your last resort. As we've previously covered, mocking focuses on either _values_ or _behaviors_. When mocking a module, you are throwing away both, and leave it up to your mock to fill in the gaps in the best way possible.

In practice, mocking modules harms more than it helps. You rarely want to mock a _module_. You are problably thinking of a particular value or a behavior introduced by that module, and you should be mocking that instead.

## Case study: Mocking Axios

A common example of module mocking is mocking `axios`. Let's take a look at how that works, what problems that has, and **why it's a bad idea**.

Here's a `fetchUser()` function that depends on `axios` to get the user by ID:

```ts filename=fetch-user.ts
import axios from 'axios'

export async function fetchUser(userId: string) {
  const response = await axios(`https://example.com/user/${userId}`)
  return response.data
}
```

What is proposed is to mock the `axios` dependency in a test in order to remove the actual HTTP request and gain control over the response returned.

```ts filename=fetch-user.test.ts highlight=4,15-17
import axios from 'axios'
import { fetchUser } from './fetch-user.js'

vi.mock('axios')

beforeEach(() => {
  vi.resetAllMocks()
})

beforeAll(() => {
  vi.restoreAllMocks()
})

test('returns the user by ID', async () => {
  axios.get.mockResolvedValue({
    data: { id: 'abc-123', name: 'John' },
  })

  await expect(fetchUser('abc-123')).resolves.toEqual({
    id: 'abc-123',
    name: 'John',
  })
})
```

The implications of mocking the `axios` module in this test are as big as they are unapparent:

1. **Tight coupling**. If the `axios.get` is renamed to `axios.request()` tomorrow, our test will fail. This is a by-the-book example of a brittle test that violates the [Golden Rule of Assertions](https://www.epicweb.dev/the-golden-rule-of-assertions).
1. **Black-box testing**. By mocking the entire `axios` import, we are throwing away _everything that Axios does_. Granted, we _do_ want to throw away some things, like actually making the request. But there's a lot of logic going on around the request that we really want to preserve in testâ€”request validation, response normalization, etc.

This is enough reason to scrap this test and start over.

You know what the purpose of mocking is now, so you can take a step back and ask yourself a question: What is it I _really_ need to mock in this test? The answer will be twofold:

1. Remove the HTTP request from the test (i.e. behavior);
1. Control what response is returned from the server (i.e. value).

The correct approach to orchestrating the test for the `fetchUser()` function is to _mock the HTTP request_ and leave the `axios` out of the picture entirely. Your users don't know what you are using Axios, and neither should your tests.

Compare the previous example with a test that uses API mocking instead:

```ts filename=fetch-user.test.ts add=2-3,8-15 remove=1,6,21-23
import axios from 'axios'
import { http } from 'msw'
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { fetchUser } from './fetch-user.js'

vi.mock('axios')

const server = setupServer(
  http.get('https://example.com/user/:userId', () => {
    return Response.json({
      id: 'abc-123',
      name: 'John',
    })
  }),
)

beforeAll(() => server.listen())
afterAll(() => server.close())

test('returns the user by ID', async () => {
  axios.get.mockResolvedValue({
    data: { id: 'abc-123', name: 'John' },
  })

  await expect(fetchUser('abc-123')).resolves.toEqual({
    id: 'abc-123',
    name: 'John',
  })
})
```

> The test no longer knows about `axios`, doesn't couple itself with the `{ data: T }` format `axios.get()` has to resolve with, and, most importantly, runs the rest of Axios code intact.

## The Argument for Module Mocking

That being said, mocking modules is still a technique you need to know. Mostly, to know of its dangers, but also because there are cases when mocking a module is preferrable. Once again, this is your last resort but it's nice to know it if that resort ever comes.
