# Fakes

One of the ways to manage dependencies is by using _fakes_.

A fake is a simplified version of a dependency. Fakes don't have any behaviors and simply act as a placeholder for the real dependency. You can use fakes to _remove_ the dependency from the testing equation, thus focusing your test on particular scenarios and behaviors.

The most straightforward example of a fake is an input object:

```ts lines=2
test('returns the first name for the given user', () => {
  const user = { firstName: 'Kody' } satisfies User
  await expect(getFirstName(user)).resolves.toBeUndefined()
})
```

The `user` object above is a _fake_ object. The real application may be pulling the user from a database or relying on the `User` class to create them. None of that is necessary to test the `getFirstName()` functionality. If it can accept the user as an argument, we can mock that argument in the test.

Now, let's look at some real code.

Here we have a `NotificationService` class that has the `sendEmail()` method that should send an email to the user:

<CodeFile file="notification-service.ts" />

It so happened that the constructor of the `NotificationService` accepts an instance of the `EmailService` as an argument:

<CodeFile file="notification-service.ts" range="4-7" highlight="5" />

üë®‚Äçüíº In this exercise, complete the tests for the <InlineFile file="notification-service.test.ts" /> by constructing a fake `EmailService` and using it as an argument to test different notification scenarios.

Once you are done, run `npm test` to make sure that all the tests are passing.
