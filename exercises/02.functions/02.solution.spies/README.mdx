# Spies

Let's start by creating a _spy_ for the `logger.log()` method using the `vi.spyOn()` function from Vitest.

<CodeFile file="user-service.test.ts" range="5-7" highlight="6" />

The `spyOn()` function has a bit of unusual call signature since it _will not_ accept the `logger.log` method reference directly. Instead, it expects the object that owns the method first, and then the method name as a string:

```ts
vi.spyOn(target, method)
```

> üìù The reason behind this call signature is how `.spyOn()` works under the hood. It redefines the `method` on the `target` object with a spied version of that method! You can think of it as `target[method] = methodSpy`.

In addition to spying on `logger.log()`, I am also _overriding its behavior_ by adding the `.mockImplementation()` part to the spy. By doing that, I'm telling my test that I want to focus on the `UserController` class using the `logger` instance correctly, and not on what the logger instance does in its `.log()` method.

Now that we have the spy ready and recording, I can write an assertion on that method being called with the correct arguments using the `.toHaveBeenCalledWith()` assertion:

<CodeFile file="user-service.test.ts" range="14" />

Finally, I will make sure that `logger.log()` has been called exactly once:

<CodeFile file="user-service.test.ts" range="15" />

To validate the test, I will run `npm test`:

```
 ‚úì user-service.test.ts (1)
   ‚úì logs out the "createUser" event when creating a new user
```
