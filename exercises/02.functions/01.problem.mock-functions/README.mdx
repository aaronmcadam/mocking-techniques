# Mock functions

We have an `Emitter` implementation that can add listeners to events and call those listeners whenever a matching event is emitted. This behavior is achieved by implementing two core methods on the emitter: `.on()` and `.emit()`:

<CodeFile file="emitter.ts" range="7-22" nocopy />

<CodeFile file="emitter.ts" range="24-44" nocopy />

Here's how this emitter is used in our application:

```ts
// The owner of the emitter describes which events it can handle.
// This keeps the communication type-safe!
const emitter = new Emitter<{ login: [User] }>()

// The consumers then attach listeners to events...
emitter.on('login', (user) => {})

// ...and emit events when needed.
emitter.emit('login', currentUser)
```

We have a single strong intention behind the `Emitter` class:

> When event X is emitted, call all the listeners for that event.

One of the ways to write such a test is to make the event listener perform a side effect and assert on the result of that side effect.

```js highlight=2,5
const emitter = new Emitter<{ hello: [string]}>()
let isListenerCalled = false

emitter.on('hello', (firstName) => {
  isListenerCalled = true
})
emitter.emit('hello', 'John')

expect(isListenerCalled).toBe(true)
```

> If the `hello` event listener gets called, it will change the value of the `isListenerCalled` and the test would pass.

It may seem like we are covering the intention here but in reality, we are not. All we are testing here is that `isListenerCalled` becomes `true` at some point. The test will pass even if the initial value for the variable is mistakingly set to `true`, and fail if we forget to update it even if the listener has been called correctly.

In other words, in this test, we are testing _what_ the listener does, not _if_ it gets called. The fact of it getting called becomes an [implicit assertion](https://www.epicweb.dev/implicit-assertions). Such assertions are tremendously useful but **the main intention we are testing must always be clear and explicit**.

👨‍💼 Your task in this exercise is to write a proper test for the listener being called, using the `vi.fn()` function from Vitest.
