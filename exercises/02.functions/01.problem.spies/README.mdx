# Spies

Spies (`vi.spyOn()` + `.toHaveBeenCalledWith()`). Spy and assert on the unmodified behavior.

- Make this an open-end exercise where the student is presented with a code and has to write tests for it using mocks.
- Help the student validate what should be mocked and what shouldn't. Intentionally show them some internals of the function and explain why some things are OK to mock (related to the expectations) and some are not (lead to implementation detail testing).
