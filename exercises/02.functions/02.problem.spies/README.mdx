# Spies

Testing the intentions around side effects is always tricky. Like this `UserController` class that's supposed to log out the `createUser` event whenever a new user is created:

<CodeFile file="user-service.ts" highlight="7" nocopy />

To make things more complicated, logging out the event is not the responsibility of the `UserController` class. Instead, it relies on the `Logger` class and its `.log()` method to do that. So while the actual logging logic is irrelevant in the context of `UserController`, we still have to test the intention of it _calling_ `logger.log()` with the correct arguments.

Luckily, the class accepts a `logger` instance as an argument:

<CodeFile file="user-service.ts" range="4" nocopy />

This means we can use a _dependency injection_ to provide it with whichever logger instance we want in test. For example, a logger that we will üïµÔ∏è _spy on_.

_Spying_ is a technique to record a function's execution. It's like pressing a record button on a radio to listen to any function calls while it's being used. Spies gives us access to the information like the number of calls, the exact arguments, and the return values. Spies also allow us to completely override the behavior of any function, if we want to.

You will use both recording and overriding in this exercise.

üë®‚Äçüíº Complete the <InlineFile file="user-service.test.ts" /> test suite by adding a spy on `logger.log()`. Add the assertions on the expected spy calls and make sure that the test is passing with `npm test`.
