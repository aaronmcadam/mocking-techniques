# Mock functions

Mock functions (`vi.fn()`). Mock a function so the tested code can run (setup phase). Better than using plain `() => {}` dummies because those will not compile in TypeScript:

```ts
// ❌ If "b: (n: number) => number",
// providing an empty function will error.
make({ b: () => {} })
       ^^^^^^^^^^^

// ✅ Using "vi.fn()" infers the "b" type.
make({ b: vi.fn() })
```

> `vi.fn()` is usually for the things you control, like arguments.

- `localStorage` is a commonly used API and it's a global object. The values stored can also be objects! May be a good candidate for the example.

- Can also use a primitive `EventEmitter` implementation to test the _expectation_ of the `listener` function being called when a certain event occurs. A side effect? The student learns a bit about how emitters work!
