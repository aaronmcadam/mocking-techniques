# Mock implementation

Let's start by creating a `isItemInStock` mock function using the `vi.spyOn()` method to spy on `OrderController.prototype.isItemInStock` method:

<CodeFile file="OrderController.test.ts" range="3" />

This means that whenever an order controller instance is created in this test, and its `.isItemInStock()` method is called, we can spy on it and affect its behavior.

Before we do any of that, let's remember the rule of thumb of mocks, which is to always clean up after oneself.

I will add the `afterEach()` test hook that will call the [`.mockClear()`](https://vitest.dev/api/mock.html#mockclear) method on the `isItemInStock` mock function:

<CodeFile file="OrderController.test.ts" range="5-7" />

Clearing the mock guarantees that none of the recorded calls of `.isItemInStock()` will leak to irrelevant tests.

Following this, I will use the `afterAll()` hook to restore any mocks and spies introduced in this test by calling [`vi.restoreAllMocks()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-restoreallmocks):

<CodeFile file="OrderController.test.ts" range="9-11" />

> Note that `.mockClear()` is called on **individual mock functions** while `vi.restoreAllMocks()` is called on the global `vi` object.

With the setup phase covered, let's dive into writing some tests!

First, I will describe the happy path scenario when all the cart items are in stock and the order is created without any issues. For that to happen, the `.isItemInStock()` method must return `true`. Up until this point, I've only established a _spy_ on the method but now it's time to _override its implementation_ to model the behavior I need for this test case.

I will call the [`.mockReturnValue()`](https://vitest.dev/api/mock.html#mockreturnvalue) method on the `isItemInStock` mock function to make it always return `true`:

<CodeFile file="OrderController.test.ts" range="13-14" highlight="14" />

What's left for this test is to write the assertion that the `order` returned matches the object we expect:

<CodeFile file="OrderController.test.ts" range="25-34" />

> Note that I'm _repeating_ the contents of the `cart` instead of referencing the existing `cart` variable created in the test. Keeping tests explicit and clear is the key to long-lasting tests!

Now, to testing the error scenario.

The `.createOrder()` method should throw an error if any of the cart items is out of stock. In other words, if the `isItemInStock` mock function returns `false`. For this test case, I will use the [`.mockImplementation()`](https://vitest.dev/api/mock.html#mockimplementation) helper from Vitest instead of mocking the return value. This will allow me to also test the correct error message containing only the items that were out of stock.

<CodeFile file="OrderController.test.ts" range="37-40" highlight="38-40" />

> Using `.mockImplementation()` allow me to control how the mock function behaves. It will still be called, and it will still receive the actual `cart` as the argument, but it will be _my test_ deciding what happens next.

Right now, only the cart item with id `4` will be considered in stock. Since the test `cart` object contains items `4`, `5`, and `6`, I can write an assertion that expects the thrown error message to contain the out-of-stock items `5` and `6`:

<CodeFile
  file="OrderController.test.ts"
  range="43-63"
  highlight="50,55,61-63"
/>

...

<CodeFile file="OrderController.test.ts" />

## Alternative approach

Because we are mocking the `.isItemInStock()` method entirely in this test, we focus our the logic of the `.createOrder()` method. That's where we've established the boundary.

Alternatively, we could've mocked the dependency on `stock.json` to decide which items are in stock on the data level. Notice how that would've yielded a different test that would also include the functionality of the `.isItemInStock()` method (the filtering).
