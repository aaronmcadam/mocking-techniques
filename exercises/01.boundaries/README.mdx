# Boundaries

- Mocking is a tool to establish _test boundaries_.
- What is a "test boundary"?

---

- Mocking is about telling "I don't care" about a particular piece of code. This code is not related to what I'm trying to test.

Build a simple app and deploy it separately (`https://howmocks.work`?) that does the following:

1. Shows an abstract code graph describing two modules:

```
- A
  - methodOne()
  - methodTwo()
    - B
      - methodThree()
        - thirdParty()
          - httpCall()
```

1. There's a slider on the page. When you move the slider, parts of the module graph become grayed-out, indicating thta they are mocked out. The left-most state of the slider is "code as-is", the right-most state is "everything mocked". _You never want to be on either end of the slider_.
