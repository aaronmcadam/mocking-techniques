# Mocking Techniques

TODO

- You use mocking for two things: to _exlcude_ irrelevant things (A depends on B, and I just want to test A), and to _control_ things that are unpredicatble (network requests, time, etc).
- When you want to control things, you want to control two types of things: _values_ and _behaviors_ (I treat states as either: observable state is a value; non-observable state is a behavior).
