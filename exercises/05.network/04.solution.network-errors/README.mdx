# Network errors

I will start from implementing the error handling for network errors in `get-auth-token.ts` module.

Unlike error responses, network errors will _reject the `fetch` promise_. This means that I can react to those errors in the `catch` callback attached to that promise:

<CodeFile file="get-auth-token.ts" range="8-16" highlight="14-16" />

> I am storing the original `error` as the `cause` property of the consumer-facing error for debugging purposes.

Next, let's mock the network error in the test.

In the `get-auth-token.test.ts`, I will head to the new empty test case and add a runtime handler that will respond with a network error:

<CodeFile file="get-auth-token.test.ts" range="44-49" highlight="45-49" />

> With this request handler, _any_ request to the `POST https://api.example.com/auth` endpoint within this test will result in a network error. Note that I'm not trying to make the responses input-dependent, and instead model a reliable scenario that represents the one I want to test.

Finally, I will add an assertion for the `getAuthToken()` promise to verify that it rejects with the correct error message:

<CodeFile file="get-auth-token.test.ts" range="51-56" />
