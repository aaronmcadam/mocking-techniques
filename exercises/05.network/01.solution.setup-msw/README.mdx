# Set up MSW

With MSW set up, we can now run `npm test` and see the outgoing request's method and URL printed during the test run:

```txt highlight=7
$ npm test

> test
> vitest

stdout | get-auth-token.test.ts > returns the authentication token on successful authentication
POST https://api.example.com/auth

 ❯ get-auth-token.test.ts (1)
   × returns the authentication token on successful authentication
```

This confirms that MSW is able to intercept the request we make in `getAuthToken()`. But the test itself is still failing!

```
Caused by: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND api.example.com
```

Althought the error is caused by use requesting a non-existing hostname, the underlying issue is that we still **allow the test to make the actual request**.

It is time for us to change that by mocking that request with MSW.
