# Timers

For once, let's take a "break" and work on some utility functions. Something that would make our developer lives easier while being much more scoped and managed.

Something like a `debounce()` function!

<CodeFile file="debounce.ts" />

The intention behind the `debounce()` function is to accept a `callback` and keep delaying its execution until a certain time `duration` has passed since its last call. For example, consider this usage scenario:

```ts
// Create a debounced function of "foo"
// with the debounce duration of 250ms.
const bar = debounce(foo, 250)
bar('one')
bar('two')
bar('three')
```

Here, the `bar()` function is just a debounced wrapped over `foo()`. Not all calls to `bar()` will translate to the calls of `foo()` (hence, the whole point of debouncing). Here's what's happening in the example above:

- `bar('one')` gets called, starting a 250ms timer for `foo('one')`.
- `bar('two')` gets called, cancelling the previous timer and starting a new one for `foo('two')`.
- `bar('three')` gets called, cancelling the previous timer and starting a new one for `foo('three')`.
- 250ms passes without any calls to `bar()`, and the `foo('three')` finally gets called.

Let's try writing this very use case in an automated test:

```ts filename=debounce.test.ts
test('executes the callback after the debounce timeout', () => {
  const foo = vi.fn<(input: string) => void>()
  const bar = debounce(foo, 250)

  bar('one')
  bar('two')
  bar('three')

  expect(foo).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
  expect(foo).toHaveBeenCalledWith(3)
})
```

Running this test, however, will produce something _unexpected_:

```txt highlight=6
 FAIL  debounce.test.ts > executes the callback after the debounce timeout
AssertionError: expected "spy" to be called once, but got 0 times
 ‚ùØ debounce.test.ts:19:15
     7|   bar(3)
     8|
     9|   expect(foo).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
```

The `foo()` function is not called at all!

Our assertions throw because they run _immediately_ after the debounced calls. We aren't taking the timeouts each debounce call create into account at all. I think it's time we did.

You already know how to mock date and time using the `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.setSystemTime()` methods, but this exercise doesn't just require you to mock them, it requires you to _advance_ the time.
